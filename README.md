Project Title: Building a CNN from Scratch to Achieve Maximum Accuracy with the MNIST Dataset: Training, Evaluation, and Experimental Analysis

Introduction: The convolutional neural network (CNN) serves as a fundamental architecture for image classification tasks. This project focuses on constructing a CNN and optimizing its parameters to achieve the highest possible accuracy with the MNIST dataset. The experimentation explores the impact of layer size and depth, activation functions such as ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and Sigmoid, and optimizers including SGD, Adam, and RMSprop. It also examines how varying learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs influence training dynamics and final accuracy, while combining these parameters to identify the most effective configurations.
